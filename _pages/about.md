Background
======
Miss. Chen is an M.Phil. student, supervised by [Dr. Gao Shang](https://goldsainteagle.github.io/shanggao.github.io/), in the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Before she came to Hong Kong, she received the B.Eng. degree majoring in information security at North China University of Technology. She was the Research Assistant with [Prof. He Yunhua](http://lwss.ncut.edu.cn/TutorServlet?action=queryDs&teacherid=YTx75JjaQGkuE4yNcPF9Ig==) and [Prof. Zheng Chao](http://lwss.ncut.edu.cn/TutorServlet?action=queryDs&teacherid=cdHELk601RdNXiezPlHCVw==) at the North China University of Technology. During her bachelor's study, she has published several academic conference and journal papers.

Research Interests
======
Broadly speaking, I am interested in information security and applied cryptography. Specifically, my current research mainly focus on ring signature, post-quantum cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, security in Internet of Things and also blockchain.
